### Report on Coke Zero and Aspartame

#### Introduction  
Coke Zero, a popular low-calorie beverage, has been a subject of scrutiny regarding its ingredients. This report examines whether Coke Zero contains aspartame and discusses the medical side effects associated with aspartame consumption based on recent research findings.

#### Does Coke Zero Contain Aspartame?  
Coke Zero, rebranded as Coke Zero Sugar in 2017, contains two artificial sweeteners: **aspartame** and **acesulfame potassium**. These sweeteners are used to provide a sweet taste without the calories associated with sugar. Acesulfame potassium is about 200 times sweeter than sugar and does not contribute calories [1][2][3].

#### Medical Side Effects of Aspartame  
Aspartame has been the subject of debate regarding its safety and potential health risks. Here are significant findings from recent research:

1. **Possible Carcinogenicity**: In June 2023, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified aspartame as **Group 2B**, indicating that it is "possibly carcinogenic to humans." This classification suggests there is limited evidence of its potential to cause cancer in humans, raising concerns among health experts [2][4].

2. **Health Risks**: A comprehensive review published in 2023 expressed concerns regarding the health effects of non-sugar sweeteners, including aspartame. The study indicated that while aspartame is generally considered safe in small amounts, there are potential risks associated with its consumption, particularly with long-term use [5].

3. **Mixed Evidence**: The World Health Organization (WHO) noted that while aspartame has been linked to possible carcinogenic effects, there is insufficient scientific evidence to confidently assert that it increases cancer risk. This highlights the need for further research [4][6].

4. **Other Health Effects**: Some studies have suggested that excessive consumption of aspartame could exacerbate certain health issues, such as headaches and allergic reactions in sensitive individuals [5].

#### Conclusion  
Coke Zero does contain aspartame, a sweetener that has been classified as possibly carcinogenic by the IARC. Although it is considered safe in small amounts, there are ongoing concerns and debates regarding its long-term health effects. Consumers should be aware of these potential risks and consider moderation in their consumption of products containing aspartame.
